Amarillo hops impart a distinct flowery, spicy, tropical, citrus-like flavor and aroma in beer. The citrus has qualities of orange and lemon, like Cascade, but much stronger. Other aroma descriptors include grapefruit, melon, apricot and peach. Amarillo hops offer solid bittering properties in the 9-11% Alpha Acid range. It also packs one of the highest myrcene oil contents (60-70% of total oils) of any hop. This extremely high Myrcene content gives it a very sweet citrus flavor and aroma that is closer to oranges than grapefruit. Amarillo has become one of craft brewer's most favorite hops. It is often paired with Citra, Simcoe, and Mosaic in many juicy IPAs and pale ales. Read More: The Most Common Hops Used in IPAs",

It single-handedly defined the American Pale Ale style. Defined by its citrus, and often more specifically grapefruit flavor, this hop accounts for around 10% of the US's harvest of hops. Cascade also has a medium-intense floral and spice citrus qualities. When used as a bittering hop, it imparts moderate bitterness. It is most famous for being the finishing hop in Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, widely considered the beer that launched the IPA and bitter beer craze. Cascade hops are widely available and are grown in multiple countries. It is usually packaged hop pellets, but is sometimes available fresh around harvest time. Cascade hops can grown at home since they are not a trademarked variety. Read More: The Most Common Hops Used in IPAs",

Haas for 39 years, originally created the plant that would eventually become Citra back in 1990. Gene crossed two unnamed varieties and formed what was known as X-114 or HBC 394 for years. While the two hop varieties directly used to create it were unknown, their parentage included American Tettnanger, Brewer’s Gold, Hallertau Mittelfrüh, East Kent Goldings and an unknown hop variety, most likely an American wild hop. A single plant was selected by hop farmer Jason Perrault in 1992 and then expanded to a test plot of four plants in 1993. This plot was located in Washington state. The evaluation went so well that by 2003 it was expanded to 21 plants. It would be more than four additional years before the hop would be ready for commercial tests. US hops begin to be harvested in mid-to-late August for most aroma varieties.",
            "flavorTxt": "Citra is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process. The Citra hop is a high alpha acid hop with a strong, yet smooth floral and citrus aroma and flavor. It has specific aroma descriptors that include grapefruit, citrus, peach, melon, lime, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee. These tropical fruit flavors have made Citra the most popular hop to craft brewers in the world. Citra adds a smooth bitterness when added to the boil. This is due to Citra having a fairly high alpha acids percentage, while also having enough flavor and aroma to be considered an aroma hop. Citra overtook Cascade as the most grown hop variety in 2018 and has yet to relinquish that title. Citra has redefined what could be expected out of a hop. It helped push IPAs to the forefront of craft brewing popularity with its extreme citrus flavors. Read More: The Complete History of the Citra Hop",

After an agreement was reached between the two names, both names were registered. They are technically the same hop however. It is genetically distinct from Zeus hops, but has a very similar profile. The exact lineage of Columbus is unknown, however it is widely assumed that Brewer’s Gold and several undisclosed American varieties played significant parenting roles. It was developed in the 1980s by Charles Zimmerman who had worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until 1979 and who subsequently held positions with various private hop-processing and trading companies. US hops begin to be harvested in mid-to-late August for most aroma varieties.",
            "flavorTxt": "Columbus is a dual-purpose hop that can be used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process. Specific aroma descriptors of the Columbus hop includes earthiness, black pepper, licorice, spice (curry) and subtle citrus. The floral and citrus notes from the Columbus hop come out in both aroma and flavor, but can be pungent. This strong flavor and aroma make the Columbus hop great for late additions to a boil or dry-hopping. Read More: The Rise and Eventual Fall of the CTZ Hop",

Galaxy hops are all tropical fruit with little to no floral, pine, or spice flavors or aromas. Galaxy is an extremely versatile hop variety. They can work compliment other hops perfectly, or take center stage as the primary flavor. Their high alpha acid content make them especially suited to late boil and dry hopping.
